# SortProject
My lab work is comparing the sorts of 11 different types. 
In my work, I tried to implement the code according to the principles of SOLID and DRY adopted in the development.
There is Russian naming in my work, it was done deliberately to show that I implemented all the sorting myself. I don't do this in other projects.
